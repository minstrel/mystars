This is a program to calculate the current position of objects (currently fixed stars) in the sky.

Currently, the output comes within a few minutes of what Stellarium shows at the same geographic coordinates.

I'm wondering if there may be issues related to periodicity of the arcsin and arctan functions, but so far I haven't been able to break anything by moving locations into the southern hemisphere or tracking stars below the horizon.
